        The code following this comment creates an icon, but its properties are wrong.
        We want the icon to be smaller and directly to the left of the title.
        We should also make it a darker color so we can see it more easily against the background.

        SetPixelX and SetPixelY tells the app where to position the BOTTOM-LEFT corner of an object.
        A pixel X value of 0 is located at the far left edge of the app. A pixel y value of 0 is located at the bottom edge of the app.

        SetPixelWidth and SetPixelHeight sets how many pixels wide and tall the object is, respectively.

        DO THIS:
        * Change the values in "SetPixelWidth" and "SetPixelHeight" to make the icon smaller
        * Change the values in "SetPixelX" and "SetPixelY" to put the icon in the right place
        * Change the color of the icon to something darker (e.g. black) so it's easier to see

        Once you've finished adjusting the previous icon, create a brand new one.
        We want to display another icon directly to the right of the title.

        To create a new Icon, we use the CreateIcon action. For example:
       
        Icon myNewIcon = CreateIcon("My Image File.png")

        The second word ("myNewIcon" in the example) is a name or ID for this Icon. You can replace that name
        with any name you want, so long as it doesn't contain spaces, start with a number, or have the same ID
        as another item you've made.

        Once you've made your Icon and set its properties, we also need to add it to a page in our app.
        To do this, we use "homePage:Add(myNewIcon)". "homePage" is the ID of the page that we're working on, and
        between the parenthesis, you should put the ID of your Icon.

        DO THIS:
        * Make a brand new Icon using CreateIcon
        * Set its properties so it's the same size and color as the last icon
        * Set the icon's properties so it appears to the right of the title
        * Add the icon to the page by using "homePage:Add(myIconName)", replacing "myIconName" with the ID of your icon

        */


        // Place your code for the second icon above this line!

        AddPage(homePage)
